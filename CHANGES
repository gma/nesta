= 0.9.5 / (Unreleased)

 * Added --version option to nesta command (Christopher Lindblom).

 * Bug fix: Made article_summaries render summaries for the articles
   passed to it (Robert Syme).

 * Bug fix: Don't use parent's heading in page title if parent's heading
   is blank (Christopher Lindblom).

 * Bug fix: Removed trailing whitespace inside <a> tags generated by
   the display_menu() helper.

= 0.9.4 / 18 February 2011

 * Updated the link colours in the default theme.

 * Set the default encoding to UTF-8. Without it Heroku would sometimes
   fail to render pages (issue 14).

= 0.9.3 / 18 January 2011

 * The route and view for serving the home page (/) has been removed, 
   and the home page must now be created as an index page in
   content/pages.

   You will have to create `content/pages/index.haml` manually when
   upgrading. Running `nesta new mysite.com` will create a
   `content/pages/index.haml` file that is suitable for a blog.

 * The URL /my-page can be served from `pages/my-page/index.mdown` as
   well as pages/my-page.mdown (index pages can also be created with
   Textile or Haml, just like any other page).

 * The description and keywords settings have been removed from
   config.yml as they can now be set on `content/pages/index.haml`.

 * Added the Title metadata key to override a page's default title tag.

 * Specify the sort order of pages that are listed on a category page.
   Optionally append a colon and a number to a path in the 'Categories'
   metadata to control the sort order of pages listed on the category
   page.

   See these files for the syntax:
   https://github.com/gma/nesta-demo-content/tree/master/pages/examples

 * Support arbitrarily deep hierarchies when generating the breadcrumb
   (see the new helper method added to Nesta::Navigation).

 * Dropped the --heroku switch (Heroku runs fine without it and there is
   less chance that committing config.yml to your repository will be an
   issue now that Nesta sites live in their own repositories).

 * Re-implemented /articles.xml and /sitemap.xml in Haml, dropping the
   dependency on builder. This side steps a bug in Ruby 1.9.1, so Nesta
   can now run on 1.9.1 again. Also fixed a validity error in the Atom
   feed.

 * Bug fix: Don't output empty <li> tags for nested submenus that are
   beneath the requested number of levels.

= 0.9.2 / 10 January 2011

 * Made the FileModel.metadata method public, to allow for custom
   metadata at the top of each page. (Wynn Netherland)

 * Relaxed the stringent dependency specifications, using pessimistic
   version constraints (see http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16).

 * Added templates required by `nesta theme:create`.

= 0.9.1 / 31 December 2010

 * Re-implemented the default theme, using semantic HTML5 and
   Andy Clarke's Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS. Named the previous
   default theme "slate" and moved it into a separate GitHub project.
   https://github.com/gma/nesta-theme-slate

 * Added `--git` switch to `nesta new`, that will create a new git
   repository and make an initial commit.

 * Moved the navigation helpers into the Nesta::Navigation::Renderers
   module.

= 0.9.0 / 20 December 2010

 * Packaged Nesta as a gem for the first time, instead of as a template
   site that can be cloned, edited and deployed. Added the `nesta`
   command for generating new sites and managing themes.

= Previous versions / from 26 November 2008

 * Prior to 0.9.0 Nesta was distributed as a git repository that could
   be forked, edited and deployed. The only change log for these
   versions is the Git commit history.
