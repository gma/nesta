= 0.9.11 / (Unreleased)

 * Use Tilt to render the Markdown, Textile and Haml in content/pages.
   RDiscount is now the default Markdown processor. To continue using
   Maruku add it to Gemfile and call `Tilt.prefer Tilt::MarukuTemplate`
   in your app.rb file.

 * Remove trailing slashes from all URLs, redirecting to the URL without
   the slash. See ticket #60 on GitHub.

 * Bug fix: require nesta/plugin automatically on load. The
   Nesta::Plugin.register method is called by plugins as soon as they
   are loaded, so we need to make it available. In 0.9.10 this method
   wasn't available until too late.

 * Bug fix: Minor updates to the files generated by `nesta plugin:create`.

 * Bug fix: Don't allow retrieval of the contents of any file
   within the content folder by crafting a relative path containing
   the string '../' (Louis Nyffenegger).

= 0.9.10 / (9 September 2011)

 * Load Nesta plugins from gems. Any gem whose name begins with
   nesta-plugin- can be used in a project by adding it to the project's
   Gemfile beneath the `gem "nesta"` line. New plugins can be created
   with the `nesta plugin:create` command.

 * Mark pages as draft by setting a flag. Draft pages won't be shown in
   production, but will be visible on your local copy of your site (as
   it's running in production).

 * Upgraded Sinatra to version 1.2.6. Upgraded other dependencies to
   latest compatible versions.

 * Bug fix: The `stylesheet` helper method assumes that you're using
   the Sass rendering engine by default, which allows it to find .sass
   files within the gem if no matching files are found locally.

= 0.9.9 / (24 August 2011)

 * Bug fix: What a debacle this is turning into. The new Nesta::Env
   class must be required before the code in 'nesta/app' is loaded.
   The previous release only loaded Nesta::Env when your started Nesta
   via config.ru. Running Nesta any other way lead to an immediate
   crash.

= 0.9.8 / (22 August 2011)

 * Bug fix: The Sinatra app's root directory wasn't set which meant
   that Nesta couldn't always find the ./public directory (such as when
   running on Heroku).
   
   The modifications made in 0.9.6 to make Nesta easier to mount inside
   another Rack application moved Nesta::App.root to the (new)
   Nesta::Env class. In 0.9.6 I forgot to actually set Nesta::App.root
   as well, which was a big mistake. Whoops.

= 0.9.7 / (19 August 2011)

 * No code changes from 0.9.6; version number increased to allow new gem
   to be deployed to rubygems.org.

= 0.9.6 / (18 August 2011) [never released due to packaging bug]

 * Nesta no longer cares whether you write your Sass stylesheets in the
   original indented Sass format or the default SCSS syntax (which is a
   superset of CSS). To use this functionality within your own site or
   theme change change any calls to the existing `sass` or `scss`
   helpers to `stylesheet`. (Isaac Cambron, Graham Ashton)

 * Add an HTML class ("current") to the menu items whose path matches
   the current page.

 * Bug fix: Strip trailing # characters from Markdown headings at the
   top of a page.

 * Bug fix: Don't render the return value of local_stylesheet_link_tag
   directly into the page (haml_tag now writes direct to the output
   buffer).

 * Bug fix: Removed trailing whitespace inside <a> tags generated by
   the display_breadcrumbs() helper.

 * Bug fix: Nesta::App.root couldn't be set until after nesta/app was
   required. Odd that, as the only reason to want to change
   Nesta::App.root would be before requiring nesta/app. Fixed by
   creating Nesta::Env and moving root to there instead.

= 0.9.5 / (1 May 2011)

 * Added --version option to nesta command (Christopher Lindblom).

 * Upgraded Haml and Sass to version 3.1 (Andrew Nesbitt).

 * Updated the URL from which the Disqus JavaScript is loaded
   (Sidharta Surya Kusnanto).

 * Bug fix: Don't use parent's heading in page title if parent's heading
   is blank (Christopher Lindblom).

 * Bug fix: Removed trailing whitespace inside <a> tags generated by
   the display_menu() helper.

 * Bug fix: Made article_summaries render summaries for the pages
   passed into it (Robert Syme).

 * Bug fix: Empty files in the content directory would cause the site to
   crash - they are now served properly.

 * Bug fix: When pages written in Haml were included on a category page
   the default theme didn't provide access to Sinatra's helper methods
   within Haml templates. See https://github.com/gma/nesta/pull/18
   (Carl Furrow).

= 0.9.4 / 18 February 2011

 * Updated the link colours in the default theme.

 * Set the default encoding to UTF-8. Without it Heroku would sometimes
   fail to render pages (issue 14).

= 0.9.3 / 18 January 2011

 * The route and view for serving the home page (/) has been removed, 
   and the home page must now be created as an index page in
   content/pages.

   You will have to create `content/pages/index.haml` manually when
   upgrading. Running `nesta new mysite.com` will create a
   `content/pages/index.haml` file that is suitable for a blog.

 * The URL /my-page can be served from `pages/my-page/index.mdown` as
   well as pages/my-page.mdown (index pages can also be created with
   Textile or Haml, just like any other page).

 * The description and keywords settings have been removed from
   config.yml as they can now be set on `content/pages/index.haml`.

 * Added the Title metadata key to override a page's default title tag.

 * Specify the sort order of pages that are listed on a category page.
   Optionally append a colon and a number to a path in the 'Categories'
   metadata to control the sort order of pages listed on the category
   page.

   See these files for the syntax:
   https://github.com/gma/nesta-demo-content/tree/master/pages/examples

 * Support arbitrarily deep hierarchies when generating the breadcrumb
   (see the new helper method added to Nesta::Navigation).

 * Dropped the --heroku switch (Heroku runs fine without it and there is
   less chance that committing config.yml to your repository will be an
   issue now that Nesta sites live in their own repositories).

 * Re-implemented /articles.xml and /sitemap.xml in Haml, dropping the
   dependency on builder. This side steps a bug in Ruby 1.9.1, so Nesta
   can now run on 1.9.1 again. Also fixed a validity error in the Atom
   feed.

 * Bug fix: Don't output empty <li> tags for nested submenus that are
   beneath the requested number of levels.

= 0.9.2 / 10 January 2011

 * Made the FileModel.metadata method public, to allow for custom
   metadata at the top of each page. (Wynn Netherland)

 * Relaxed the stringent dependency specifications, using pessimistic
   version constraints (see http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16).

 * Added templates required by `nesta theme:create`.

= 0.9.1 / 31 December 2010

 * Re-implemented the default theme, using semantic HTML5 and
   Andy Clarke's Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS. Named the previous
   default theme "slate" and moved it into a separate GitHub project.
   https://github.com/gma/nesta-theme-slate

 * Added `--git` switch to `nesta new`, that will create a new git
   repository and make an initial commit.

 * Moved the navigation helpers into the Nesta::Navigation::Renderers
   module.

= 0.9.0 / 20 December 2010

 * Packaged Nesta as a gem for the first time, instead of as a template
   site that can be cloned, edited and deployed. Added the `nesta`
   command for generating new sites and managing themes.

= Previous versions / from 26 November 2008

 * Prior to 0.9.0 Nesta was distributed as a git repository that could
   be forked, edited and deployed. The only change log for these
   versions is the Git commit history.
