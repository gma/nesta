# Title and subheading for your site. Used on the home page and in page
# titles.
#
title: "My Site"
subtitle: "(change this text in config/config.yml)"

# You should really specify your content's author when generating an
# Atom feed. Specify at least one of name, uri or email, and Nesta will
# include it in your feed. See the Atom spec for more info:
#
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.1.1
#
# author:
#   name: Your Name
#   uri: https://yourdomain.com
#   email: you@yourdomain.com

# You can stick with the default look and feel, or use a theme. Themes are
# easy to create or install, and live inside the themes directory. You
# can also use scripts/theme to install them.
#
# theme: name-of-theme

# If you want to use the Disqus service (https://disqus.com) to display
# comments on your site, register a Disqus account and then specify your
# site's short name here. A comment form will automatically be added to
# the bottom of your pages.
#
# disqus_short_name: mysite

# content
#     The root directory where nesta will look for your article files.
#     Should contain "pages" and "attachments" subdirectories that contain
#     your actual content and the (optional) menu.txt file that links to your
#     main category pages.
#
content: content

# google_analytics_code
#     Set this if you want Google Analytics to track traffic on your site.
#     Probably best not to set a default value, but to set it in production.
#
#     The production settings are used if you're deploying to Heroku, so
#     scroll down a bit to set it in production even if you're not deploying
#     to your own server.
#
# google_analytics_code: "G-??????????"

# read_more
#     When the summary of an article is displayed on the home page, or
#     on a category page, there is a link underneath the summary that
#     points to the rest of the post. Use this value to customize the
#     default link text. You can still override this value on a per-page
#     basis with the 'Read more' metadata key.
#
# read_more: "Continue reading"

# Overriding "content" in production is recommended if you're deploying
# Nesta to your own server (but see the deployment documentation on the
# Nesta site). Setting google_analytics_code in production is recommended
# regardless of how you're deploying (if you have a GA # account!).
#
# Don't forget to uncomment the "production:" line too...

# production:
#   content: /var/apps/nesta/shared/content
#   google_analytics_code: "G-??????????"

# The following settings control the behaviour of the `nesta build`
# command, which is used to generate a "static" version of your site.
# It's optional, but allows you to deploy your site on hosting providers
# that serve pre-prepared HTML and CSS files (instead of generating them
# in real-time with a web server).
#
# You can either set the `domain` key here, or specify it on the command
# line with the `--domain` switch. Nesta needs to know your site's
# domain name so that it can generate the correct URLs in sitemap.xml,
# and in your Atom feed.
#
# The templated_assets setting is a list of the things that Nesta
# generates for you, other from all the page in your content directory.
# The example below is for a site that has two stylesheets, both of
# which are converted from .sass or .scss files in your ./views folder.
#
# If you're not using Sass and are just editing CSS files directly, you
# can keep them in your ./public folder and Nesta's build command will
# find them automatically.
#
# build:
#   domain: yourdomain.com
#   templated_assets:
#     - /css/master.css
#     - /css/local.css
